Ultrahand Overlay is a [Tesla Menu](https://github.com/WerWolv/Tesla-Menu) replacement built from the ground up off of [libtesla](https://github.com/WerWolv/libtesla) that provides powerful C/C++ commands through the usage of its own custom interpretive programming language (similar to Shell/BASH).  It is a versatile tool that enables you to create and share custom command-based packages, providing enhanced functionality for managing settings, files and directories on your Nintendo Switch.

With Ultrahand, you have the flexibility to customize and shape your file management system according to your needs, empowering you with greater control over your system configurations.

## Getting Started

### Usage

To use Ultrahand, follow these steps:

1. Download and install the latest [nxovloader](https://github.com/WerWolv/nx-ovlloader).
2. Download the latest Ultrahand [ovlmenu.ovl](https://github.com/ppkantorski/Ultrahand-Overlay/releases/latest/download/ovlmenu.ovl) and place it within `/switch/.overlays/`.
    - WARNING: This will overwrite `Tesla Menu` if already installed.
3. After installing Ultrahand Overlay, a new folder named `ultrahand` will be created within the root config folder on your SD card (`/config/ultrahand/`) along with a `config.ini` file containing various Ultrahand settings.
4. Launch Ultrahand similarly to `Tesla Menu` with your specified hotkey.  A new folder will be made (`/switch/.packages/`) with a preset `package.ini` file for your base menu commands.

5. Place your custom `package.ini` package file in your Ultrahand package directory (`/switch/.packages/<PACKAGE_NAME>/`). This file will contains the commands for your custom Ultrahand package.
6. Your commands will now show up on the packages menu within Ultrahand.

## Additional Features
- You can click `A` to execute any command as well as click `MINUS` to view/execute the individual command lines written in the ini for execution.
- You can click `PLUS` on the main menu to enter the settings menu.
- You can click `X` on top of an overlay/package to star them.
- You can click `Y` on top of an overlay/package to configure additional settings.

For additional assistance with custom packages, feel free to checkout the [Ultrahand Overlay Wiki](https://github.com/ppkantorski/Ultrahand-Overlay/wiki).

### Nintendo Switch Compatibility
To run Ultrahand Overlay on the Nintendo Switch, you need to have the necessary [homebrew environment](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) set up on your console running HOS 16.0.0+. Once you have the homebrew environment set up, you can transfer the compiled .ovl to your Switch and launch it using your old `Tesla Menu` hotkeys.

Please note that running homebrew software on your Nintendo Switch may void your warranty and can carry certain risks. Ensure that you understand the implications and follow the appropriate guidelines and precautions when using homebrew software.

### Compilation Prerequisites

To compile and run the software, you need to have the following C/C++ dependencies installed:

- [custom libtesla fork](https://github.com/ppkantorski/Ultrahand-Overlay/tree/main/lib/libtesla)
- switch-curl
- switch-zziplib
- switch-mbedtls
- switch-jansson
